Knapsack: With CPLEX and its ILP solver feature, runnning knapsack was surprisingly fast (finished solving all instances combined within a second). The solver even produced precise results for the largest instance with ease and little time. For the knapsack part we used a script knapsapRunner.sh to run every instance quickly.
