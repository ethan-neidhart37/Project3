Knapsack: With CPLEX and its ILP solver feature, runnning knapsack was
surprisingly fast (finished solving all instances combined within a second).
The solver even produced precise results for the largest instance with ease and
little time.

Graph Coloring: Using an ILP formulation to solve the graph coloring instances,
we found that the algorithm produced much better results than either the greedy
algorithm or the exhaustive algorithm for large instances. For small instances,
all three algorithms were about identical, because they all hit the same
ceiling. However, this algorithm had the median runtime of the three. Running
in exponential time, it still took much longer than the greedy algorithm,
though it would take much larger instances than the exhaustive algorithm to hit
the 10 minute runtime limit; instances 96-6 and larger hit the limit, while
instances 48-6 and smaller ran almost instantly. It is also interesting to note
that if an instance had a "perfect solution", or one where there the conflicts
could be minimized to 0, the algorithm would run instantly no matter how large
the instance was.
